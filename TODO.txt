// Adam's Match Score Algorithm
Have they played together?
Team A (Side A) = 0 & 1
Team B (Side B) = 2 & 3
Team A Player 1 -> played against Team B (player 3 & 4) (any)?
Team A Player 2 -> played against Team B (player 3 & 4) (any)?
Each player -> Minutes waiting * 4 (benefit those waiting longest)


High score = bad...



Badminton Tasks to do before V1

- The case of the vanishing players when abandoning
- Match time not updating
- Saving - don't duplicate the players (may mess up with querying by Player reference)
- Courts Available dropdown (must finish match e.g. if all in use before changing to only 3 available)
