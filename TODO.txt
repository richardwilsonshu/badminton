FYI - Deployment:

https://www.hanselman.com/blog/how-to-make-a-winforms-app-with-net-5-entirely-from-the-command-line-and-publish-as-one-selfcontained-file

-== Option 1 (Visual Studio) ==-
Just right-click "Badminton" project -> Publish -> click "Publish" on FolderProfile.pubxml

Output: \bin\Release\net6.0-windows\publish\win-x64

-== Option 2 (Command Line) ==-
```
dotnet publish -r win-x64 -c Release /p:PublishSingleFile=true /p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true --self-contained true
```

Output: \bin\Release\net6.0-windows\win-x64\publish

-------------------------------

Note that it is a big exe (~150MB) since it includes the whole runtime and cannot be trimmed.
It is a self-contained exe.

!! Note !!
Regarding losing data / recovery - I'd recommend using a free tier Dropbox account to host the exe and badminton.json



// Adam's Match Score Algorithm
Have they played together?
Team A (Side A) = 0 & 1
Team B (Side B) = 2 & 3
Team A Player 1 -> played against Team B (player 3 & 4) (any)?
Team A Player 2 -> played against Team B (player 3 & 4) (any)?
Each player -> Minutes waiting * 4 (benefit those waiting longest)


High score = bad...



Badminton Tasks to do before V1 (Deadline by end of 24th)

- Saving - don't duplicate the players (may mess up with querying by Player reference)
- Integrate Adam's matchfinding code
